H BROS FRONT END MENU
=====================
What's the big idea?
. The H Bros online ordering is ugly and confusing.
. We should replace it with a friendlier front end,
. which would allow users to create custom plates
. far more easily, as well as allow them to get a
. better idea of what they're ordering.
What's the design?
. I intend on creating a simple visual menu similar
. to how pizza places have their menus. There will be
. a sidebar to the right with menu options as well as
. a table (or something) with images in it, which will
. change depending on the item being ordered.
. The order will then go through Toast's API and through
. their order processing system. I'll have to collaborate
. with them on that front, as I don't know how their
. API works, or how to access it.
What's the schedule?
. I am set to have a prototype ready by December 14th,
. one month from today (Nov. 14th). Hopefully I can have
. it done by then!
. A detailed schedule is yet to be made. I have 4.5 weeks.
.. Week 0.5 - 1.5: Rough sketch - Get a page running
.. that has the sidebar and responsive menu.
.. Week 1.5 - 2.5: Refine - Make sure all parts are running
.. smoothly. Add sample images. Begin linking with an example
.. server (use your x10 hosting).
.. Week 2.5 - 3.5: Perhaps begin work on a mobile adaptation.
.. Week 3.5 - 4.5: Polish! Get ready for a demo.
